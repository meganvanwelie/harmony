Hi, I'm Megan. I'm a software developer currently living in Boston, MA.
I have a BS in electrical and computer engineering from WPI and a
MS in computer science from Tufts University. I've recently branched into
the world of visual computing, and I'm excited to continue exploring the
field and developing shareable experiences.

Aside from programming, I spend my free time knitting, listening to music,
and enjoying the company of my amazing family and friends.
